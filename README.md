## Portfolio

This weeks project was to start from scratch and make a portfolio about ourselves and show off some of the work that we have learned and somthething that we reference along the way through this class. this does not have much at the moment as we just started class but im hoping to add to it and update this as we go thorugh the course and really looking forward to that.

### Link to website!

This is a work in progress and will be adding to it

##### Cube Project
Also have a cube project that is in the 02-Homework folder. This is something that i was and am working on but i have realized that it will not work in any browsers as the roateX() function no longer works in web-broswers. It works in codepen.io so once im finished I will update this with a new link!
